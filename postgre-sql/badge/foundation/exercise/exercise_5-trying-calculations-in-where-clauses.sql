Trying Calculations in Where Clauses
We are once again working with the phones table.

Write a query that will print the name and total_revenue of all phones with a total_revenue greater than 1,000,000

Hints

Remember that total_revenue can be found by multiplying price and units_sold columns!

Don't forget to rename the column produced by price X units_sold to total_revenue using the AS operator

Only the calculation in the SELECT clause needs to be renamed, not the one in the WHERE clause.
